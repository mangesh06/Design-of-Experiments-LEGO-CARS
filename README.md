# README: Optimizing Lego Car Performance Using Design of Experiment

## Project Overview

This project focuses on applying Design of Experiment (DOE) principles to optimize the performance of a Lego car. By systematically varying factors such as car length, load type, tire size, number of tires, and car height, the objective is to determine the optimal parameter combination that maximizes the Lego car's travel distance.

## Introduction

Design of Experiment (DOE) is a powerful methodology used to optimize processes and improve outcomes across various fields. This project utilizes DOE principles to enhance a Lego car's performance, employing statistical tools like Minitab to identify and analyze key factors that influence the car's travel distance.

## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to identify the optimal combination of factors that allow the Lego car to cover the maximum distance. This involves systematically varying selected parameters and using statistical analysis, specifically Minitab, to determine the most influential factors.

## Factors Considered

The experiment considered the following factors:
1. **Car Length**
2. **Air Dams**
3. **Number of Wheels**
4. **Spoilers**
5. **Car Height**

## Experimental Setup

- **Track**: A ramp with a 22-degree inclination, using a whiteboard as the ramp.
- **Environment**: Controlled to minimize blocking effects with a clear path (carpet flooring) in a closed room.
- **Replications**: 3 replications of 4 factors, resulting in 48 observations.

## Minitab Implementation

Minitab, a robust statistical software, was crucial in analyzing the experiment. The project started with a one-half fraction experiment using the principle of sparsity of effects. Minitab was used to record the distance covered by the Lego car for each factor combination and develop a predictive model.

### Analysis Phases

1. **Initial Phase**: Designed a one-half fraction experiment and analyzed the data using Minitab to create a predictive model.
2. **Refinement Phase**: Eliminated non-significant factors to refine the model, focusing on the most significant factors influencing the car's travel distance.

## Results and Discussion

- **Significant Factors**: The ANOVA analysis indicated that car length (Factor A) and the number of wheels (Factor C) are significant factors.
- **Optimal Combination**: Maximizing the distance covered by keeping the car length high and the number of wheels low.
- **Residuals Analysis**: Residuals were found to follow a Normal and Independent Distribution (NID), validating the model's assumptions.

### Key Insights

- **Main Effects**: Length and the number of wheels are crucial for optimizing the car's performance.
- **Interaction Effects**: Interaction between car length and other factors also plays a significant role.
- **Financial Analysis**: No direct relation was found between the cost of the car and the distance covered within the narrow price range of the experiment.

## Conclusion

The DOE analysis revealed that the Lego car's performance is significantly influenced by its length and the number of wheels. The project demonstrated the effectiveness of using DOE and Minitab for systematic optimization, providing valuable insights into the factors affecting the Lego car's performance.

## Recommendations

- **Length and Number of Wheels**: Focus on these two factors to design a car that covers the maximum distance.
- **Further Research**: Explore a broader range of prices to understand the cost-performance relationship better.

## Final Note

This comprehensive project serves as an example of the efficacy of Design of Experiment in enhancing processes, with Minitab proving indispensable for statistical analysis and model refinement. It lays the groundwork for future research and optimization in the field of Lego car performance.
